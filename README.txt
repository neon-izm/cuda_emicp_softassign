* Requirements

CUDA 5.0 or higher


* How to use the demo application

** Windows : open vcxproj and build
(Only test with CUDA6.0)
https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads
** Fedore 16 (x86_64)

  $ ./src/CUDA_EMICP_SOFTASSIGN --help


** Usage
============================================================
CUDA_EMICP_SOFTASSIGN [options]

This demo application finds R and t such that min ||X - (R*Y+t) || for given 3D point sets X and Y.

At the start, the demo application popups a window where two point sets are shown.
    Press 'q' to start (restart) the alignment (after and during the alignment).
    Press 'Esc' to quit the demo (after and during the alignment).a
    Press either '1', '2', or '3' to toggle on/off of the point sets.

Examples:
$ ./src/CUDA_EMICP_SOFTASSIGN -pointFileX=./data/P101.txt -Xsize=101 -pointFileY=./data/Qnew101.txt -Ysize=101 -emicp
    This aligns P101.txt and Qnew101.txt (both of 101 points) by using EM-ICP.

$ ./src/CUDA_EMICP_SOFTASSIGN -ply -pointFileX=./data/bun000.ply -pointFileY=./data/bun045.ply -pointsReductionRate=5 -softassign
    This aligns bun000.ply and bun045.ply by using Softassign. Numbers of points in both point sets are reduced (randomly approximately) 5% of its original numbers.

Demonstrations:

$ make -f Makefile.demo demo




Options:

Files of 3D point sets:
-pointFileX=filename
-pointFileY=filename
    [string] Filename of two 3D point sets. Requred.
    Format of file: in each line, x y z coordinates are stored. That’s all. Number of points are specified with Xsize and Ysize options.
-Xsize=***
-Ysize=***
    [int] Numbers of points in pointFileX and pointFileY. Required unless -ply is specified.
-ply
    Assume that pointFileX and pointFileY are the PLY format. x,y,z of “property float” in “element vertex” are loaded as x,y,z coordinates.

Reduction number of points:
[-pointsReductionRate=** | -pointsReductionRateX=** -pointsReductionRateY=**]
    [float] Numbers of points in the files are randomlyl reduced to ** % (approximately). default: no reduction.
    Example: -pointsReductionRate=10 then the number of points is reduced to about 10%.
    Note: pointsReductionRate reduces both pointFileX and pointFileY, while pointsReductionRateX (or pointsReductionRateY) reduces pointFileX (or pointFileY).

Algorithms:
[-icp | -emicp | -emicpcpu | -softassign]
    Choose one of these. default: -softassign is assumed.

Softassign parasmters:
-JMAX=***
    [int] Number of iterations for the annealing loop (1st loop). At first, the annealing temprature T is set to T_0, then T <- T*TFACOR at the end of each iteration. default: 100
-I0=***
    [int] Number of iterations with the same temprature (2nd loop). default: 5
-I1=***
    [int] Number of iterations for Shinkhorn’s row/column normalizations. default: 3
-alpha=***
    [float] parameter for outliers (see the original Softassign paper). default: 3.0
-T_0=***
    [float] initial temprature for the annealing process. default: 100.0
-TFACTOR=***
    [float] factor for reducing temprature. default: 0.95
-moutlier=***
    [float] values of elements in the extra row/column for outliers (see the original Softassign paper). default: 1/sqrtf(T_0)*expf(-1.0f)

ICP parameter:
-maxIteration=***
    [int] Number of ICP iterations. default: 30

EM-ICP parameters:
-sigma_p2=***
    [float] initial value for the main loop. sigma_p2 <- sigma_p2 * sigma_factor  at the end of each iteration while sigma_p2 > sigam_inf. default: 0.01
-sigma_inf=***
    [float] minimum value of sigma_p2. default: 0.00001
-sigma_factor=***
    [float] facfor for reducing sigma_p2. default: 0.9
-d_02=***
    [float] values for outlier (see EM-ICP paper). default: 0.01

MISC:
-viewer
    No alignment. Just show point sets, and quit.
-noviewer
    No viewer is shown. Just align point sets, and quit.
-notimer
    No timer is shown.
-nostop
    No interatction by the viewer is required.


Save and load R, t:
-saveRTtoFile=filename
    save the estimated rotation matrix and translation vector. default: nothing saved.
-loadRTfromFile=filename
    load initial values for rotation matrix R and translation vector t. default: no values are loaded, and set R=3x3 identity matrix, t=zero vector.

Save and load format: R and t are stored in row-wise.

============================================================

* Build the demo application

** Fedora 16
*** prepare packages:
$ yum install atlas atlas-devel "freeglut*"
*** see src/Makefile and modify the following lines acoording to your system:
 # CUDA_INSTALL_PATH := /usr/local/cuda-5.0
 # CUDASDK_INSTALL_PATH := /usr/local/cuda-5.0/samples/common/inc
 # LAPACKLIB := -L/usr/lib64/atlas -llapack -lptf77blas
 # GLUTLIB := -lglut -lGLU -lGL
*** make
$ cd src; make

** other linux
see src/Makefile and modify it acoording to your system.




* How to use the API

** interfaces:
void        icp(int Xsize, int Ysize, const float* h_X, const float* h_Y, float* h_R, float* h_t, registrationParameters param)
void softassign(int Xsize, int Ysize, const float* h_X, const float* h_Y, float* h_R, float* h_t, registrationParameters param)
void      emicp(int Xsize, int Ysize, const float* h_X, const float* h_Y, float* h_R, float* h_t, registrationParameters param)
void   emicpcpu(int Xsize, int Ysize, const float* h_X, const float* h_Y, float* h_R, float* h_t, registrationParameters param)

To use these functions,
  compile your program with either icp.cpp, softassign.cu, emicp.cu, or emicp_cpu.cpp.
    incldue 3dregistration.h.

** description
int Xsize, int Ysize [Input]
    Specify the numbers of points in h_X and h_Y.
const float* h_X, const float* h_Y [Output]
    Specify the pointers where point sets X and Y are stored.
    Note that h_X must store points in the order of
    [X_x1 X_x2 .... X_x(Xsize) X_y1 X_y2 .... X_y(Xsize)  X_z1 X_z2 .... X_z(Xsize) ]
    where (X_xi X_yi X_zi) is the i-th point in X.
    h_Y must do as the same way.
float* h_R, float* h_t [Input/Output]
    On entry, initial values for rotation matrix R and translation vector t must be given. Usually, R=3x3 identity matrix, t=zero vector.
    On exit, estimated R and t are stored.
    Order of elements:
    h_R[0], ..., h_R[8]: r11 r12 r13 r21 r22 r23 r31 r32 r33
    h_t[0], ..., h_t[2] : tx,ty,tz
registrationParameters param [Input]
    parameters for alignment. set values by yourself.
    see 3dregistration.h and usage of demo (described above).

** with/without demo viewer
If you do not use the viewer, define
#define NOVIEWER
when compling icp.cpp, softassign.cu, emicp.cu, or emicp_cpu.cpp.

If you prefer to use the viewer,
- compile algebra.cpp, engine.cpp, and orbcam.cpp and link them with freeglut.
- set pointers for the point sets in registrationParameters param.points{1,2,3} as shown in InitPointCloud() in main.cpp (or simple use InitPointCloud()).
